Predictive analytics is an enabler of big data: Businesses collect vast amounts of real-time customer data and predictive analytics uses this historical data, combined with customer insight, to predict future events. Predictive analytics enable organizations to use big data (both stored and real-time) to move from a historical view to a forward-looking perspective of the customer.
Predictive analytics and data mining solutions for the enterprise are currently available from a number of companies, including SAS (Predictive Analytics Suite), IBM (IBM SPSS Statistics), and Microsoft (Microsoft Dynamics CRM Analytics Foundation).
Vendors may offer proprietary solutions or solutions based on open source technologies. Predictive analytics software can be deployed on-premises for enterprise users or in the cloud for small businesses or for project or team based initiatives.
