
Is Earth trying to eject us from the planet? Again and again and again the harshest of winds and hardest of rains has pounded on the most-defenseless territories we have. The Caribbean islands, hanging out in open sea. The Florida peninsula, jutting out into danger. The Texas coastline, low-lying and concrete-laden. Nearly a full month of back-to-back-to-back disasters.


Now, halfway through the season, Hurricane Harvey's destruction stretches along the Texas coast, and Hurricane Irma's storm surge has turned coastal Florida streets in saltwater rivers after causing massive destruction in the Caribbean. On Irma's heels, Hurricane Jose is swirling in the Atlantic, while a third Atlantic hurricane, Katia, struck Mexico's eastern coast late Friday night.
