Records are tumbling in quick succession this year. Irma, among the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, barreled over the islands of the Caribbean as a Category 5 storm this week en route to Florida, while Houston, Texas, was still draining from Harvey's five-day deluge that broke the continental U.S. rainfall total for a single event.
According to the 2014 National Climate Assessment, the intensity, frequency and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes have increased since the early 1980s. The frequency of the strongest storms—category 4 and 5 hurricanes—has increased too.

Part of the reason for the high price tag is more people moving into "at risk" areas. In Florida alone, more than 5 million people evacuated their homes.

"Whether or not they are able to rebuild I think is a question" Walsh told CNBC's "On the Money" recently. He said that given the devastation from these storms, zoning standards for rebuilding may need to change.
