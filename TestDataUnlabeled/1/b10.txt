
What Are the Biggest Threats from Irma?

The big fear with Irma is the wind. The National Hurricane Center was reporting sustained winds of 185 mph on Wednesday and gusts even higher. Those wind speeds are similar to Hurricane Wilma, the 2005 storm that resulted in at least 62 deaths and an estimated $29.4 billion in damage, of which $21 billion occurred in the United States.
Another concern is the storm surge that can accompany hurricanes. Riding on top of sea levels that have risen due to climate change, Irma's surge could be particularly dangerous. The National Hurricane Center warned Wednesday of storm surges as high as 20 feet above normal tide levels in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Southeastern Bahamas.
